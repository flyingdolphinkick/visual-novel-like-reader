# A Visual Novel-like reading app
This is an untitled reading app that will make any text into a visual novel-esque reading experience. This was made because I realized I have a better time reading visual novels than books, focusing more on the current text rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of pages left to read. Also you can add cool images!!!1!!!1!!!!

You can check the live site at https://flyingdolphinkick.github.io/visual-novel-like-reader/, after loading it the first time you'll be able to use it offline. You can also add a shortcut to your home screen on Android for quick access.

Full disclaimer: This was made using the Google Gemini AI.
